# Brightness Tweaks

Brightness Tweaks adds an adjustable, torch-like light around the player so you can see better at night or underground.

## Features
- Player-centered dynamic light (torch effect)
- Adjustable strength with a command
- Per-player (doesn’t change world lighting for everyone)

## Commands
- `/brightness` disables the effect (resets to normal)
- `/brightness <value>` sets brightness from `0.1` to `1.0`

## Install (Server / Local)
1. Build the jar: `.\gradlew.bat build`
2. Copy `build/libs/Brightness-Tweaks.jar` to your server’s `mods/` folder (or your local `.../Hytale/UserData/Mods` folder).
3. Start/restart the server.

## Support

## Notes
- This is an early mod. Hytale’s API is still evolving; updates may be frequent.
